## Branches

The existence of three branches in this repository is guaranteed:

* **master**: contains both Palabos and additional utilities developed by PFM/JKU. Palabos is usually unmodified except
for minor bugfixes in case they arise. The latter is found in externalLibraries/plb/utils.
* **develop**: Development version. May contain newer features, but may break.
* **plb-vanilla**: contains the unmodified content of the latest version of Palabos.

Other branches present are usually temporary feature branches and should by no means used in any productive environement.

## Utilities

* [PlbCaseTimer](externalLibraries/pfm/utils/PlbCaseTimer/README.md)
* [ProbeManager](externalLibraries/pfm/utils/ProbeManager/README.md)
